    summary: `Sophia App: Sophia was created as a collaboration among Bellwether Technology Corporation, VIA LINK Inc.,
    and the United Way Association of South Carolina to address the need for a better technology solution for I&R service providers. 
    As their existing I&R software struggled to keep up with their evolving requirements, VIA LINK and UWASC each sought an answer. 
    They knew they needed an application that was specifically designed for their purposes and would adapt quickly to new developments. 
    It was clear that such a solution was not readily available and that building one was a significant undertaking with no guarantee of success.
    Having been involved in various capacities with 211s for well over a decade, 
    Bellwether understood the enormous potential for a software application that would amplify the positive impact that I&R has on the world. As a long-established and successful managed IT and cybersecurity services company, 
    Bellwether also understood that getting the most from technology is as much about people as it is about machines and software.
    Discussions among executive leadership at the three organizations led to a tight collaboration to design and build a new solution, with each member bringing their unique perspective and expertise to the partnership. 
    The result is Sophia: a modern I&R solution guided by VIA LINK’s and UWASC’s vision and propelled by Bellwether’s 40+ years of technical leadership and customer service excellence.
